                    <p>
                    The Clone Wars (22–19 BBY) was a galaxy-spanning conflict between the 
                    <strong>Galactic Republic</strong> and the <strong>Confederacy of Independent Systems</strong>. 
                    Orchestrated by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, the war was designed to destroy the Jedi Order 
                    and pave the way for the Galactic Empire.
